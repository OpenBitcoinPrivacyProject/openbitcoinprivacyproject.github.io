### Funding Principles

The goal of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is to facilitate the creation of sustainable projects that improve financial privacy in the crypto-currency space. These projects will most often be crowd-funded, and thus must extend the utility of Bitcoin in order to appeal to [speculative philanthropists](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-correct-strategy-of-bitcoin-entrepreneurship/).
